# Haller-s_Halls
my final project repo


Welcome to the Hallers Hall's antigue webs store.

CURRENTLY STILL IN DEVELOPMENT

This app uses React-Redux and a Rails back to serve and display User and their associated items.  The app uses no cookies and implements
Redux-Persist to pass along relevant information including JWT auth tokens.

This app is also responsive across most modern devices using the bootstrap framework.
